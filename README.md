# Automated Workflow

*Automated Workflow* is an open-source alternative to Zapier, allowing you to connect various services and automate business processes seamlessly. This powerful automation platform empowers you to create workflows with triggers and actions from popular services like GitHub, Slack, Twitter, and more—all without any programming knowledge.

## Key Features
- *No-Code Workflow Builder*: Automate tasks and processes with a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.
- *Multi-Platform Integration*: Integrate with popular services such as Twitter, Slack, GitHub, and others.
- *Frontend*: Built using React and GraphQL for a modern, responsive, and efficient user experience.
- *Backend*: Powered by Express.js to handle workflow logic, event processing, and integrations.
- *Automated Workflows*: Trigger workflows from events like GitHub webhooks, form submissions, or time-based schedules, and execute actions like sending emails, SMS, or making HTTP requests.
- *Scalable*: Fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scaling across environments.
- *Custom Actions*: Build and define your own actions, allowing flexibility beyond predefined ones.
- *Data Management*: Securely manage and store data between triggers and actions.

## Comparison with Zapier
- *Open-Source*: Unlike Zapier, which is a closed platform, Automated Workflow is open-source under the MIT license. Customize it to fit your needs.
- *Self-Hosted*: You control your data by hosting the platform on your own infrastructure.
- *Cost-Effective*: No subscription fees. It’s free to use, and you only incur costs for your own hosting and resource usage.
